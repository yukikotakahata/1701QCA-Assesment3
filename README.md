# 1701QCA Making Interaction - Assessment 3 workbook

You will use GitHub to keep track of your progress through the course and also as a process journal to document the making of your projects.

You can fill out the workbook from the GitHub website using markdown language for the documents and they will be turned into web pages for you. See the markdown reference guide here: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Specific instructions for each part of the journal will be included as comments in the markdown (.md) file. Ensure that you don't accidentally end up commenting out parts of your journal that you intend to be visible.

The template for the front page of this assessment is in the file `index.md` in the main directory of this repository. The file `journal.md` in the subfolder `journal` will contain much of your journal information.
